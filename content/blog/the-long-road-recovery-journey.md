## The Update Nobody Wants to Write

I keep starting this post and deleting it. How do you tell people that you're still stuck? That the inspiring recovery arc you hoped to write hasn't materialized? That two months later, you're still fighting the same battles, just with different weapons?

But honesty has been my compass through this journey, and I owe it to anyone following along, and to myself, to admit the truth: the last two months have been harder than I anticipated. The job search timeline I confidently set in May? It came and went. June passed. July passed. And here I am in October, still searching, still struggling, still finding my way.

## When Your Body Keeps Writing Checks Your Mind Can't Cash

I thought I had it figured out. Sunlight, exercise, therapy, routine. The formula seemed to be working. My resting heart rate was dropping. Sleep was improving. I was cautiously optimistic.

Then my body decided to remind me who's really in charge.

It started subtly. A flutter in my chest during a coding session. A slightly elevated heart rate that didn't quite settle. Nothing dramatic, just enough to notice. Then it escalated. Palpitations that would strike randomly, turning ordinary moments into anxiety triggers. Sitting at my desk, preparing for an interview, even during meditation sessions that were supposed to calm me.

Back to the doctor. More tests. More concerned looks. And then the explanation that felt both validating and frustrating: chronic stress had sent my cortisol levels into chaos. My adrenal system was essentially stuck in fight-or-flight mode, flooding my body with stress hormones even when there was no immediate threat.

"Your body is reacting to stress that's already passed," the doctor explained. "It's like your alarm system is broken. It keeps going off even after you've checked and confirmed there's no fire."

## The Medicine Cabinet Chronicles

My nightstand has transformed into a small pharmacy. It's almost comedic if it weren't so necessary. Let me give you the tour:

L-Arginine for cardiovascular support. Magnesium glycinate because apparently my stress response has been depleting this crucial mineral. Ashwagandha to help regulate cortisol. B-complex vitamins because chronic stress is also a vitamin thief. Omega-3 supplements for heart health. Melatonin to help reset my sleep cycle.

And the prescription that felt like defeat when I first got it: actual sleep medication. Not forever, the doctor assured me. Just to break the insomnia cycle and give my body the rest it desperately needs to heal.

## Finding Peace in Ancient Melodies

If there's been a consistent source of solace through these two months, it's been the bhajans and hymns I've grown increasingly attached to. What started as a desperate experiment has become a daily ritual I can't imagine living without.

Morning bhajans while I take my supplements and medication. Afternoon prayers during the hours when anxiety typically peaks. Evening devotional music as I wind down for the medicated sleep that's become necessary. The melodies have woven themselves into my routine, creating pockets of peace in otherwise turbulent days.

## The Honest Ending

This isn't the update I wanted to write. I wanted to tell you about job offers and recovered health and confidence restored. About timelines met and goals achieved. About the inspiring transformation from struggle to success.

Instead, I'm telling you about palpitations and supplements. About grief and low confidence. About extended timelines and uncertain readiness. About the humbling reality that recovery takes as long as it takes, regardless of what we wish or plan.

But maybe this honesty is more valuable than false triumph. Maybe someone needs to hear that it's okay to still be struggling months later. That taking medication for sleep doesn't make you weak. That losing confidence doesn't mean it can't be rebuilt. That pausing your job search to focus on healing isn't giving up.

I'm still here. Still trying. Still healing. Still looking forward to brighter days, even when I can't quite see them yet. Still finding peace in bhajans and sunlight and small improvements in health metrics. Still believing that eventually, I'll be ready.

Just not quite yet. And that's okay.

Until the next chapter,
Aniket

*(Still technically open to opportunities, but let's be real: what I need right now is time to heal, not another job application. And admitting that feels more honest than any polished pitch ever could.)*

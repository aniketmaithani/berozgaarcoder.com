            <div class="post-content">
                <p>There's something deeply satisfying about automating repetitive tasks. For me, sending invoices to clients every month was one of those tasks that ate up more time than it should have. Creating invoices, tracking which ones were sent, following up with reminders, it all felt mechanical and soul-crushing.</p>

                <p>So I did what any developer would do: I built a Python system to handle it all automatically. No fancy third-party services, no expensive subscription tools, just Python, AWS SES, and a JSON file to keep track of everything.</p>

                <p>In this post, I'll walk you through how I built this system, the challenges I faced, and the lessons I learned along the way. By the end, you'll have a working understanding of how to automate your own invoicing workflow.</p>

                <h2>Why Automate Invoicing?</h2>

                <p>Before diving into the code, let me explain why this was worth the effort. I work with multiple clients, each with different payment terms and schedules. Some pay monthly, others bi-weekly. Keeping track manually meant:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Setting calendar reminders for each client</li>
                    <li>Manually creating invoice PDFs or emails</li>
                    <li>Tracking which invoices were sent and which were paid</li>
                    <li>Following up with late payments</li>
                    <li>Losing sleep over whether I forgot to invoice someone</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The automation solved all of this. Now, my system runs daily, checks who needs an invoice, sends it automatically, and reminds clients who haven't paid. I barely think about invoicing anymore.</p>

                <h2>The Tech Stack: Keeping It Minimal</h2>

                <p>I wanted to keep external dependencies to a minimum. Here's what I used:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Python 3.9+</strong> for the core logic</li>
                    <li><strong>boto3</strong> (AWS SDK) for interacting with SES</li>
                    <li><strong>JSON files</strong> for storing invoice data and tracking state</li>
                    <li><strong>datetime and timedelta</strong> (built-in) for date calculations</li>
                    <li><strong>smtplib</strong> (built-in) as a fallback option</li>
                </ul>

                <p>That's it. No Django, no Flask, no database (initially). Just simple, maintainable Python code.</p>

                <h2>Setting Up AWS SES</h2>

                <p>Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) is perfect for this use case. It's cheap (essentially free for low volumes), reliable, and doesn't require running your own mail server.</p>

                <h3>Getting Started with SES</h3>

                <p>First, I had to set up SES in my AWS account. Here's the process:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Go to AWS Console and navigate to SES</li>
                    <li>Verify your sender email address (the one you'll send invoices from)</li>
                    <li>If you're in the SES sandbox, verify recipient emails too</li>
                    <li>Request production access to send to any email address</li>
                    <li>Create an IAM user with SES sending permissions</li>
                    <li>Generate access keys for programmatic access</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Once that's done, I stored my AWS credentials securely. I created a <code>config.py</code> file that reads from environment variables:</p>

                <pre><code>import os

AWS_REGION = os.getenv('AWS_REGION', 'us-east-1')
AWS_ACCESS_KEY = os.getenv('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
AWS_SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
SENDER_EMAIL = os.getenv('SENDER_EMAIL', 'invoices@yourdomain.com')

# Invoice settings
INVOICE_DUE_DAYS = 15
REMINDER_DAYS = [7, 3, 1]  # Days before due date to send reminders</code></pre>

                <p>Never hard-code credentials. I learned this the hard way when I almost committed AWS keys to GitHub once. Use environment variables or AWS secrets manager.</p>

                <h2>Building the Invoice Tracker</h2>

                <p>The heart of the system is a simple JSON file that tracks all clients and their invoice status. I call it <code>invoices.json</code>:</p>

                <pre><code>{
  "clients": [
    {
      "id": "client_001",
      "name": "Acme Corporation",
      "email": "billing@acme.com",
      "rate": 5000,
      "billing_cycle": "monthly",
      "last_invoice_date": "2025-10-14",
      "next_invoice_date": "2025-11-14",
      "invoices": [
        {
          "invoice_id": "INV-2025-001",
          "date_sent": "2025-10-14",
          "amount": 5000,
          "status": "paid",
          "due_date": "2025-10-29",
          "date_paid": "2025-10-25"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "client_002",
      "name": "TechStart Inc",
      "email": "finance@techstart.com",
      "rate": 3500,
      "billing_cycle": "bi-weekly",
      "last_invoice_date": "2025-11-01",
      "next_invoice_date": "2025-11-15",
      "invoices": []
    }
  ]
}</code></pre>

                <p>This structure gives me everything I need: client details, billing frequency, invoice history, and payment status.</p>

                <h3>Loading and Saving Data</h3>

                <p>I created simple helper functions to work with this data:</p>

                <pre><code>import json
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def load_invoice_data(filepath='invoices.json'):
    """Load invoice data from JSON file."""
    try:
        with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
            return json.load(f)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return {"clients": []}

def save_invoice_data(data, filepath='invoices.json'):
    """Save invoice data to JSON file."""
    with open(filepath, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(data, f, indent=2)

def get_next_invoice_id():
    """Generate the next invoice ID."""
    data = load_invoice_data()
    year = datetime.now().year

    # Count invoices from current year
    count = sum(1 for client in data['clients']
                for inv in client.get('invoices', [])
                if inv['invoice_id'].startswith(f'INV-{year}'))

    return f'INV-{year}-{count + 1:03d}'</code></pre>

                <p>The beauty of using JSON is simplicity. No database setup, no migrations, just a text file that's human-readable and easy to backup.</p>

                <h2>Creating the Email Content</h2>

                <p>Now comes the fun part: crafting the actual invoice email. I wanted it to look professional without relying on external templating libraries. Plain HTML with inline CSS does the trick:</p>

                <pre><code>def create_invoice_email(client, invoice_id, amount, due_date):
    """Generate HTML email content for invoice."""

    subject = f"Invoice {invoice_id} from BerozgaarCoder"

    html_body = f"""
    &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;style&gt;
                body {{ font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; }}
                .container {{ max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 20px; }}

                <p>I always include both HTML and plain text versions. Some email clients prefer plain text, and it's good practice for accessibility.</p>

                <h2>Sending Emails with AWS SES</h2>

                <p>Now for the core function that actually sends emails using boto3:</p>

                <pre><code>import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
import config

def send_email_via_ses(to_email, subject, html_body, text_body):
    """Send email using AWS SES."""

        'ses',
        region_name=config.AWS_REGION,
        aws_access_key_id=config.AWS_ACCESS_KEY,
        aws_secret_access_key=config.AWS_SECRET_KEY
    )

    try:
        response = ses_client.send_email(
            Source=config.SENDER_EMAIL,
            Destination={
                'ToAddresses': [to_email]
            },
            Message={
                'Subject': {
                    'Data': subject,
                    'Charset': 'UTF-8'
                },
                'Body': {
                    'Text': {
                        'Data': text_body,
                        'Charset': 'UTF-8'
                    },
                    'Html': {
                        'Data': html_body,
                        'Charset': 'UTF-8'
                    }
                }
            }
        )

        print(f"Email sent successfully! Message ID: {response['MessageId']}")
        return True

    except ClientError as e:
        print(f"Error sending email: {e.response['Error']['Message']}")
        return False</code></pre>

                <p>The boto3 library handles all the heavy lifting. The <code>send_email</code> method is straightforward: you specify the sender, recipient, subject, and body (both HTML and text).</p>

                <h3>Error Handling</h3>

                <p>One thing I learned quickly is that email sending can fail for many reasons: invalid addresses, SES quotas, network issues. Always wrap SES calls in try-except blocks and log failures.</p>

                <h2>Implementing Auto-Reminders</h2>

                <p>Sending invoices is only half the battle. Clients sometimes forget to pay (or pretend to forget). That's where automatic reminders come in.</p>

                <p>My system checks daily for invoices that are approaching their due date and haven't been paid yet:</p>

                <pre><code>def check_and_send_reminders():

            # Check if we should send a reminder
            if days_until_due in config.REMINDER_DAYS:
                send_reminder_email(client, invoice, days_until_due)

                # Update last reminder sent
                invoice['last_reminder'] = today.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
                invoice['reminder_count'] = invoice.get('reminder_count', 0) + 1

                <p>The reminder logic is simple but effective. I send reminders at 7 days, 3 days, and 1 day before the due date. The tone gets progressively more urgent as the deadline approaches.</p>

                <h2>Generating and Sending New Invoices</h2>

                <p>Every day, my system checks which clients need a new invoice based on their billing cycle:</p>

                <pre><code>def process_due_invoices():
    """Check and send invoices that are due today."""

    data = load_invoice_data()
    today = datetime.now().date()

    for client in data['clients']:

            client['next_invoice_date'], '%Y-%m-%d'
        ).date()

        # Check if invoice is due today
        if next_invoice_date <= today:
            send_new_invoice(client)

            # Update next invoice date based on billing cycle
            if client['billing_cycle'] == 'monthly':
                next_date = today + timedelta(days=30)
            elif client['billing_cycle'] == 'bi-weekly':
                next_date = today + timedelta(days=14)
            elif client['billing_cycle'] == 'weekly':
                next_date = today + timedelta(days=7)
            else:
                next_date = today + timedelta(days=30)

            client['next_invoice_date'] = next_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
            client['last_invoice_date'] = today.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

    save_invoice_data(data)

def send_new_invoice(client):
    """Generate and send a new invoice to a client."""

    invoice_id = get_next_invoice_id()
    amount = client['rate']
    due_date = datetime.now() + timedelta(days=config.INVOICE_DUE_DAYS)

    # Create invoice record
    invoice = {
        'invoice_id': invoice_id,
        'date_sent': datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
        'amount': amount,
        'status': 'pending',
        'due_date': due_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
        'reminder_count': 0

        if 'invoices' not in client:

        print(f"Invoice {invoice_id} sent to {client['name']}")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to send invoice to {client['name']}")
</code></pre>

                <h2>Putting It All Together</h2>

                <p>The main script ties everything together and runs as a daily cron job:</p>

                <pre><code>def main():
    """Main function to run the invoice automation system."""

    print(f"Starting invoice automation at {datetime.now()}")
    print("-" * 50)

    # Process new invoices due today
    print("Checking for due invoices...")
    process_due_invoices()

    # Send reminders for unpaid invoices
    print("\nChecking for reminder-eligible invoices...")
    check_and_send_reminders()

    print("-" * 50)
    print("Invoice automation completed successfully!")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()</code></pre>

                <p>I set this up as a cron job on my server that runs every morning at 9 AM:</p>

                <pre><code># Crontab entry
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/invoice-system && /usr/bin/python3 invoice_automation.py >> /var/log/invoice_automation.log 2>&1</code></pre>

                <p>Now the system runs automatically every day. I wake up, check the logs, and see that all invoices have been sent without me lifting a finger.</p>

                <h2>Tracking Payments</h2>

                <p>One piece I haven't automated (yet) is marking invoices as paid. For now, I have a simple helper function that I run manually when I receive payment:</p>

                <pre><code>def mark_invoice_paid(invoice_id, payment_date=None):
    """Mark an invoice as paid."""

    data = load_invoice_data()
    payment_date = payment_date or datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

    for client in data['clients']:
        for invoice in client.get('invoices', []):
            if invoice['invoice_id'] == invoice_id:
                invoice['status'] = 'paid'
                invoice['date_paid'] = payment_date
                save_invoice_data(data)
                print(f"Invoice {invoice_id} marked as paid")
                return

    print(f"Invoice {invoice_id} not found")

# Usage
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    if len(sys.argv) > 1:
        mark_invoice_paid(sys.argv[1])</code></pre>

                <p>I run this from the command line whenever I receive a payment notification:</p>

                <pre><code>python3 invoice_automation.py mark_paid INV-2025-023</code></pre>

                <p>Eventually, I plan to integrate this with payment gateway webhooks (like Stripe or PayPal), but for now, manual entry works fine.</p>

                <h2>Lessons Learned and Improvements</h2>

                <p>Building this system taught me several valuable lessons:</p>

                <h3>1. Start Simple, Iterate Later</h3>

                <p>My first version was even simpler than this. It just sent one invoice to one client. I gradually added features: multiple clients, reminders, tracking, HTML emails. Don't try to build everything at once.</p>

                <h3>2. JSON Works Until It Doesn't</h3>

                <p>For my needs (5-10 clients), JSON is perfect. But if you have hundreds of clients or complex querying needs, migrate to a proper database like SQLite or PostgreSQL.</p>

                <h3>3. Test with Real Email Addresses</h3>

                <p>I initially tested with fake emails, which didn't catch issues like emails landing in spam or HTML rendering differently across email clients. Test with real addresses (your own) in different email providers.</p>

                <h3>4. Monitor Your SES Metrics</h3>

                <p>AWS SES tracks bounce rates, complaint rates, and sending quotas. High bounce rates can get your account suspended. Regularly check the SES dashboard and maintain good email hygiene.</p>

                <h3>5. Keep Logs</h3>

                <p>I added logging throughout the code. When something goes wrong at 3 AM, you'll be grateful for detailed logs that tell you exactly what happened.</p>

                <h3>Future Improvements I'm Considering</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>PDF Generation:</strong> Use libraries like ReportLab to generate actual PDF invoices attached to emails</li>
                    <li><strong>Payment Gateway Integration:</strong> Automatically mark invoices paid via Stripe or PayPal webhooks</li>
                    <li><strong>Dashboard:</strong> A simple web interface to view invoice status and manually trigger actions</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-currency Support:</strong> Handle clients who pay in different currencies</li>
                    <li><strong>Time Tracking Integration:</strong> Automatically calculate invoice amounts based on logged hours</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Cost and Performance</h2>

                <p>Let's talk numbers. AWS SES pricing is incredibly affordable:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>$0.10 per 1,000 emails sent</li>
                    <li>First 62,000 emails per month are free if you're sending from EC2</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Even sending 100 invoices and 200 reminders per month costs me less than $0.03. Compare that to invoice management software that charges $15-50 per month.</p>

                <p>The script runs in under 5 seconds for my current client list, even with network latency for SES API calls. It's fast, cheap, and reliable.</p>

                <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

                <p>A few important security notes:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Never commit credentials:</strong> Use environment variables or AWS Secrets Manager</li>
                    <li><strong>Use IAM roles:</strong> If running on EC2, use IAM roles instead of access keys</li>
                    <li><strong>Encrypt sensitive data:</strong> If storing payment info, encrypt it at rest</li>
                    <li><strong>Validate email addresses:</strong> Always validate and sanitize user input</li>
                    <li><strong>Rate limiting:</strong> Don't blast thousands of emails at once; SES has sending limits</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conclusion: Freedom Through Automation</h2>

                <p>Building this invoicing system was one of the best time investments I've made. It took about a weekend to build the initial version and another few hours to refine it, but it has saved me countless hours since.</p>

                <p>More importantly, it eliminated the mental overhead of tracking invoices. I no longer worry about forgetting to bill a client or missing a payment. The system handles it all, and I can focus on actual work instead of administrative tasks.</p>

                <p>The best part? This approach is extensible. You can adapt it to any kind of recurring notification system: appointment reminders, subscription renewals, report deliveries, whatever you need.</p>

                <p>If you're spending more than an hour a month on manual invoicing, you owe it to yourself to automate it. Start simple, iterate, and enjoy the freedom that comes from letting code handle the boring stuff.</p>

                <p>Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some actual coding to do instead of sending invoices. That's the dream, isn't it?</p>

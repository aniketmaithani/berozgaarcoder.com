                    <h2>The Update Nobody Wants to Write</h2>
                    <p>I keep starting this post and deleting it. How do you tell people that you're still stuck? That the inspiring recovery arc you hoped to write hasn't materialized? That two months later, you're still fighting the same battles, just with different weapons?</p>
                    
                    <p>But honesty has been my compass through this journey, and I owe it to anyone following along, and to myself, to admit the truth: the last two months have been harder than I anticipated. The job search timeline I confidently set in May? It came and went. June passed. July passed. And here I am in October, still searching, still struggling, still finding my way.</p>
                    
                    <h2>When Your Body Keeps Writing Checks Your Mind Can't Cash</h2>
                    <p>I thought I had it figured out. Sunlight, exercise, therapy, routine. The formula seemed to be working. My resting heart rate was dropping. Sleep was improving. I was cautiously optimistic.</p>
                    
                    <p>Then my body decided to remind me who's really in charge.</p>
                    
                    <p>It started subtly. A flutter in my chest during a coding session. A slightly elevated heart rate that didn't quite settle. Nothing dramatic, just enough to notice. Then it escalated. Palpitations that would strike randomly, turning ordinary moments into anxiety triggers. Sitting at my desk, preparing for an interview, even during meditation sessions that were supposed to calm me.</p>
                    
                    <p>Back to the doctor. More tests. More concerned looks. And then the explanation that felt both validating and frustrating: chronic stress had sent my cortisol levels into chaos. My adrenal system was essentially stuck in fight-or-flight mode, flooding my body with stress hormones even when there was no immediate threat.</p>
                    
                    <p>"Your body is reacting to stress that's already passed," the doctor explained. "It's like your alarm system is broken. It keeps going off even after you've checked and confirmed there's no fire."</p>
                    
                    <p>The palpitations weren't a new problem. They were the echo of old ones, the physical manifestation of months of accumulated stress finally demanding to be addressed.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The Medicine Cabinet Chronicles</h2>
                    <p>My nightstand has transformed into a small pharmacy. It's almost comedic if it weren't so necessary. Let me give you the tour:</p>
                    
                    <p>L-Arginine for cardiovascular support. Magnesium glycinate because apparently my stress response has been depleting this crucial mineral. Ashwagandha to help regulate cortisol. B-complex vitamins because chronic stress is also a vitamin thief. Omega-3 supplements for heart health. Melatonin to help reset my sleep cycle.</p>
                    
                    <p>And the prescription that felt like defeat when I first got it: actual sleep medication. Not forever, the doctor assured me. Just to break the insomnia cycle and give my body the rest it desperately needs to heal.</p>
                    
                    <p>I resisted at first. Taking medicine to sleep felt like admitting I couldn't handle something as basic as rest. But exhaustion eventually overrode pride. When you've spent enough nights watching the ceiling, when anxiety has stolen so many hours that should have been spent in recovery, you stop being precious about how you get the sleep your body needs.</p>
                    
                    <p>The first night I actually slept through until morning felt foreign. Seven uninterrupted hours. I woke up confused, checking the time multiple times, convinced I'd somehow misread the clock. My body had forgotten what genuine rest felt like.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The Supplement Spiral</h2>
                    <p>I became that person who researches supplements at 2 AM. Forums, medical journals, Reddit threads. Everyone had a miracle solution. This herb cured their anxiety. That amino acid fixed their heart palpitations. This particular brand of magnesium changed their life.</p>
                    
                    <p>I tried them all, or at least it felt that way. Some helped. Many didn't. The L-Arginine seemed to support cardiovascular function, making the palpitations slightly less frequent. The magnesium improved my sleep quality when combined with the prescription. The ashwagandha reduced the constant underlying anxiety.</p>
                    
                    <p>But here's what nobody tells you about the supplement journey: it's slow. Painfully slow. No dramatic overnight transformations. Just incremental improvements measured in weeks, not days. You take them consistently, track your symptoms obsessively, and hope that maybe, eventually, the trend line moves in the right direction.</p>
                    
                    <p>Recovery is happening. My doctor confirms it. The numbers are improving. The palpitations are less frequent. The stress hormones are gradually normalizing. But it's time-consuming in a way that tests every ounce of patience I possess.</p>
                    
                    <p>When you're desperate to move forward with your life, with your career, being told "give it another month" feels like being sentenced to limbo. But physiology doesn't care about timelines or ambitions. It heals at its own pace.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The Grief That Nobody Talks About</h2>
                    <p>While my body was fighting its chemical battles, something else emerged that I wasn't prepared for: grief. Not the acute, obvious kind that comes from a specific loss, but the slow, pervasive grief of watching time pass while feeling stuck in place.</p>
                    
                    <p>It hits at unexpected moments. Scrolling through old photos and seeing the person I used to be—confident, energetic, unburdened by the weight of anxiety. Looking at timestamps from a year ago, two years ago, and realizing how much time has been consumed by this struggle.</p>
                    
                    <p>I grieve for the career momentum I lost. The opportunities that passed while I was too unwell to pursue them. The connections that faded because I didn't have the energy to maintain them. The projects I dreamed about starting but never did because just getting through the day required all my resources.</p>
                    
                    <p>I grieve for the simpler version of myself who didn't have to think about cortisol levels and palpitations, who could just apply for jobs without wondering if his body would cooperate during interviews. Who didn't need a pillbox organizer and a medication schedule just to function normally.</p>
                    
                    <p>The grief comes in waves, more often than I'd like to admit. Sometimes it's gentle, a quiet sadness that washes through and recedes. Other times it's overwhelming, leaving me staring at my screen unable to code, unable to apply, unable to do anything but feel the weight of everything that's been lost.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The Timeline Time Machine</h2>
                    <p>I've developed a masochistic habit: scrolling through old social media timelines and photos. I know it's not healthy. My therapist has gently suggested I stop. But there's something compelling about it, like pressing on a bruise to confirm it still hurts.</p>
                    
                    <p>Photos from Dehradun, Delhi, Bangalore.... to start at Amazon, proud of making it to a FAANG company, believing I'd finally made it. Screenshots of code I was proud of, projects I was excited about, messages from colleagues complimenting my work. Evidence of a person who had his life together.</p>
                    
                    <p>Then the timeline gets quieter. Fewer photos. Less enthusiasm. The visual documentation of a slow decline. You can almost see the anxiety creeping into the frame, uninvited but increasingly present.</p>
                    
                    <p>What am I looking for in these digital archives? Proof that I was once okay? Evidence that I can be again? Or maybe I'm just trying to pinpoint the exact moment things started unraveling, as if identifying the source code of the bug will help me fix it.</p>
                    
                    <p>But timelines are dangerous places for people in pain. They show you the highlight reel of your past and invite comparison with the blooper reel of your present. It's an unfair contest you'll always lose.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Keeping Morale High (Or Trying To)</h2>
                    <p>Every morning I give myself a pep talk. Today will be different. Today I'll feel better. Today I'll have the energy and focus to tackle my job applications with renewed vigor. Today the palpitations won't come. Today I'll feel like myself again.</p>
                    
                    <p>Some days it works. I manage to complete a few LeetCode problems with genuine focus. Send out applications that feel thoughtful rather than desperate. Have conversations with recruiters where I sound capable rather than uncertain. Those days feel like victories, like proof that I'm climbing out of this hole.</p>
                    
                    <p>Other days, the pep talk echoes hollowly in the space between who I'm trying to be and who I actually am. The motivation crumbles by noon. The palpitations arrive like uninvited guests. The grief settles in. And I spend another day trying to convince myself that tomorrow will be different.</p>
                    
                    <p>I've tried everything to keep morale high. Gratitude journaling. Affirmations. Celebrating small wins. Reaching out to friends. Following motivational accounts. Reading success stories. Some of it helps. Most of it feels like putting a band-aid on a deeper wound.</p>
                    
                    <p>The truth is, it's challenging. More challenging than I thought it would be when I optimistically declared my two-month timeline back in May. Chronic health issues are like compound interest in reverse—they drain your resources slowly but consistently, and the effects accumulate in ways you don't notice until you're exhausted.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Finding Peace in Ancient Melodies</h2>
                    <p>If there's been a consistent source of solace through these two months, it's been the bhajans and hymns I've grown increasingly attached to. What started as a desperate experiment has become a daily ritual I can't imagine living without.</p>
                    
                    <p>Morning bhajans while I take my supplements and medication. Afternoon prayers during the hours when anxiety typically peaks. Evening devotional music as I wind down for the medicated sleep that's become necessary. The melodies have woven themselves into my routine, creating pockets of peace in otherwise turbulent days.</p>
                    
                    <p>I can't fully explain why this works when so many other interventions haven't. Maybe it's the rhythmic patterns that regulate my nervous system. Maybe it's the cultural familiarity that provides comfort. Maybe it's simply that the music asks nothing of me except to listen, and in a life that demands constant effort toward recovery, that absence of demand is itself healing.</p>
                    
                    <p>My mother noticed. "You've become more spiritual," she observed, though I'm not sure spiritual is the right word. I haven't suddenly found religion or developed new beliefs. But I have found something that quiets the noise, that creates space between the anxiety and my response to it.</p>
                    
                    <p>The bhajans remind me that people have been struggling and seeking peace for centuries. That whatever I'm going through isn't unprecedented or unsurvivable. That there are wells of calm to draw from even in the midst of internal chaos.</p>
                    
                    <p>When my heart starts racing and I feel the panic rising, I put on a familiar hymn and breathe. Just breathe. The music doesn't stop the palpitations, but it changes my relationship to them. They become something to observe rather than something to fear.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The Job Search That Isn't</h2>
                    <p>Let me be honest about something I've been avoiding saying directly: I'm still looking for a job, but I'm not really ready for one yet.</p>
                    
                    <p>I send applications because it feels like I should. I prepare for interviews because that's what people in job searches do. I maintain the appearance of an active job search because admitting I'm not ready feels like failure.</p>
                    
                    <p>But the truth leaks out in small ways. The hesitation before hitting submit on applications. The relief when I don't hear back. The underlying anxiety about what would happen if someone actually wanted to hire me right now. The honest assessment that I'm not operating at the level I need to be to succeed in a new role.</p>
                    
                    <p>My confidence, already shaken by months of struggle, has taken additional hits. Every interview that doesn't go well becomes evidence that I'm not ready. Every rejection feels less like "not the right fit" and more like confirmation of inadequacy. Every day that passes without progress reinforces the narrative that maybe I've lost what it takes.</p>
                    
                    <p>I know, intellectually, that this isn't true. That I have skills and experience and value to offer. That my current struggles don't define my capabilities. But knowing something intellectually and feeling it emotionally are different beasts entirely.</p>
                    
                    <p>The confidence I projected in my first post—the clear timeline, the structured plan, the optimistic outlook—feels naive now. I was confident because I didn't yet know how long and difficult this process would be. Ignorance, it turns out, was indeed bliss.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The Admission That Hurts</h2>
                    <p>Maybe I'm not ready right now. Maybe that's okay. Maybe the most productive thing I can do for my career is to step back from the job search and focus completely on healing first.</p>
                    
                    <p>This admission feels like defeat. It feels like giving up on the timeline I set, the goals I announced, the person I claimed to be becoming. It feels like letting down everyone who's been following this journey and expecting a triumphant ending.</p>
                    
                    <p>But trying to force readiness before it exists hasn't worked. I've sent applications from a place of desperation rather than confidence. I've gone into interviews hoping they won't notice I'm struggling rather than believing I'd be an asset to their team. I've been playing defense when I need to be playing offense.</p>
                    
                    <p>What if, instead of continuing this performance, I gave myself permission to pause? To say: right now, my job is to get well. To stabilize my stress hormones. To let the supplements and medication do their work. To grieve what needs to be grieved. To listen to bhajans and find peace. To rebuild my foundation before trying to construct anything on top of it.</p>
                    
                    <p>There's no glory in this admission. No inspiring plot twist. Just the humbling recognition that sometimes, despite our best efforts and intentions, we need more time than we thought.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Looking Forward to Brighter Days</h2>
                    <p>Despite everything—the palpitations, the grief, the shaken confidence, the extended timeline—I still believe brighter days are coming. Not because I have evidence, but because the alternative is unbearable.</p>
                    
                    <p>The supplements are slowly working. My sleep, though medication-assisted, is improving. The stress hormones are gradually normalizing. The palpitations are less frequent than they were a month ago. The grief, while still present, comes in smaller waves. The bhajans continue to provide moments of peace.</p>
                    
                    <p>Progress is happening. It's just happening at the pace of biology rather than ambition. And maybe that's the lesson I needed to learn: that you can't willpower your way through physiological healing, that the body has its own timeline, and that the most efficient path forward sometimes involves slowing down.</p>
                    
                    <p>Brighter days don't mean perfect days. They mean days where the palpitations don't derail my entire afternoon. Where I can look at old photos without spiraling into grief. Where I can apply for jobs from a place of genuine confidence rather than desperate hope. Where I sleep without pharmaceutical assistance. Where my body and mind are on the same team again.</p>
                    
                    <p>I don't know when those days will arrive. November? December? Later? The uncertainty is uncomfortable, but I'm learning to sit with it. To accept that recovery refuses to be linear, that setbacks don't erase progress, and that struggling doesn't mean failing.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The Revised Timeline</h2>
                    <p>I'm not setting another deadline. Not because I'm giving up, but because arbitrary timelines based on where I thought I'd be haven't served me well. They've only created additional pressure that my nervous system doesn't need.</p>
                    
                    <p>Instead, I'm committing to the process:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Taking my supplements consistently and giving them time to work</li>
                        <li>Using the sleep medication without shame until my body relearns how to rest</li>
                        <li>Working with my doctor to monitor and adjust as stress hormones normalize</li>
                        <li>Continuing therapy to process the grief and rebuild confidence</li>
                        <li>Maintaining the routines that help: sunlight, movement, bhajans, rest</li>
                        <li>Keeping technical skills sharp with gentle, consistent practice</li>
                        <li>Applying for jobs when I feel genuinely ready, not out of obligation</li>
                        <li>Being honest about where I am rather than where I wish I was</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The goal is no longer "get a job by X date." The goal is "become the person who's ready to thrive in the right role, however long that takes."</p>
                    
                    <h2>To Anyone Else in the Waiting Room</h2>
                    <p>If you're reading this while also stuck in the liminal space between unwell and recovered, between unemployed and employed, between the person you were and the person you're becoming—I see you.</p>
                    
                    <p>If your timeline has stretched beyond what you planned, if your confidence has taken hits you didn't anticipate, if your body is healing slower than your ambition wants it to—I get it.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you're taking supplements and medications you never thought you'd need, if you're grieving time and opportunities lost, if you're trying to keep morale high while feeling anything but—you're not alone.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you've found your own version of bhajans—whatever brings you peace when nothing else can—hold onto it. Those lifelines matter more than we acknowledge.</p>
                    
                    <p>And if you're also realizing that maybe you're not ready yet, that maybe more healing needs to happen before you can move forward—that's not failure. That's wisdom. That's self-awareness. That's you being honest enough to do what actually serves you rather than what looks good on paper.</p>
                    
                    <p>The waiting is hard. The uncertainty is uncomfortable. The extended timelines feel like defeat. But we're not defeated. We're just on a longer road than we expected, learning lessons we didn't know we needed, becoming people who understand that there are some things you can't rush, no matter how badly you want to.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The Honest Ending</h2>
                    <p>This isn't the update I wanted to write. I wanted to tell you about job offers and recovered health and confidence restored. About timelines met and goals achieved. About the inspiring transformation from struggle to success.</p>
                    
                    <p>Instead, I'm telling you about palpitations and supplements. About grief and low confidence. About extended timelines and uncertain readiness. About the humbling reality that recovery takes as long as it takes, regardless of what we wish or plan.</p>
                    
                    <p>But maybe this honesty is more valuable than false triumph. Maybe someone needs to hear that it's okay to still be struggling months later. That taking medication for sleep doesn't make you weak. That losing confidence doesn't mean it can't be rebuilt. That pausing your job search to focus on healing isn't giving up.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm still here. Still trying. Still healing. Still looking forward to brighter days, even when I can't quite see them yet. Still finding peace in bhajans and sunlight and small improvements in health metrics. Still believing that eventually, I'll be ready.</p>
                    
                    <p>Just not quite yet. And that's okay.</p>
                    
                    <p>Until the next chapter,<br>Aniket</p>
                    
                    <p><em>(Still technically open to opportunities, but let's be real: what I need right now is time to heal, not another job application. And admitting that feels more honest than any polished pitch ever could.)</em></p>
